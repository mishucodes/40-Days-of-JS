//NOTE: Mr. Tapas says that we should use this when we don't know how many times we have to iterate over some code. For Example:

    //a) emptying some stack:
        let burgersDemanded = 3;
        while(burgersDemanded)
        {
            console.log('making a burger...');
            burgersDemanded--;
        }
