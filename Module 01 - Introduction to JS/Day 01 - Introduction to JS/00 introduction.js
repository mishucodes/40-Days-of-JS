//When the internet came along, suddenly computers could talk to each other. People used the World Wide Web to share documents across the globe.

//At first, these documents (web pages) were simple. They were basically text, maybe some images, and links to other pages. That was fine for reading information, but that's it. People wanted content that could change without waiting for the whole page to reload.

//In the mid-1990s, a company called Netscape was leading the browser market, and they realised that if the web was going to evolve beyond static documents, it needed a small, lightweight programming language that could run directly inside the browser. Something simple enough that designers and beginners could use, but powerful enough to make web pages interactive.

//So in 1995, Netscape asked a programmer named "Brandon Eich" to create such a language. He only had about 10 days to put together the first version. The result was JavaScript. Its purpose was clear: it could take a static page and make it come alive. Things like checking if a form was filled correctly before sending it, animating an image, responding to a button click, etc..

//Over time, JS grew. It was the only language built directly into every browser, so it became unavoidable. Websites that wanted to be dynamic had to use it. And as more developers pushed its limits, the language itself had to evolve.

//By the 2000s, JS was no longer just about small tricks on a webpage. With tools like AJAX, it became possible to update specific parts of a page without reloading the whole thing. This was the foundation of what we now call web apps â€” things like Gmail, Google Maps, or Facebook. Instead of behaving like static documents, websites began to feel more like desktop applications.

//In the 2010s, JS broke out of the browser. With Node.js, developers could run JS on the server as well, meaning the same language could now power both the frontend and the backend.
//At the same time, powerful frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue gave structure to large applications, making it easier to build entire platforms with JS.

//Today, JS is everywhere. It runs in browsers, on servers, in mobile apps, in desktop apps, even inside IoT devices.
