//01. Performance: We can argue that it consists of:
    //a) Efficiency
    //b) Responsiveness
    //c) Scalability

//02. Some Principles to keep in mind:
    //a) Debouncing: Don't act too early.
    //b) Throttling: Don't act too often.
    //c) Memoisation [Caching]: Store the result of an expensive function call so the next time you get the same inputs, you return the saved result instead of recalculating. It trades memory for speed and avoids repeated work.
